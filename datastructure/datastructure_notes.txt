Data Structure:
---------------
	Data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. 
	It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.
	
	Linear Data Structure - Data elements are arranged sequentially

		Static (fixed memory size) - Array
		Dynamic (memory size is not fixed) - Queue, Stack, Linked List
		
	Non-Linear Data Structure - Data elements are not placed sequentially
		Tree
		Graph


Traversing - Visit the element stored in it.
Searhing
Insertion
Deletion


Algorithms:
-----------
Searching -

Dynamic Programming - 

Sorting - 
TC - O(N log N) 
	Bubble Sort -- Compare two elements in array and swap the largest item to left.
		TC - Best - O(n), Worst - O(n^2)  SC - O(1)
	
	Insertion Sort -- 
		TC - Best - O(n), Worst - O(n^2)  SC - O(1)
	
	Selection Sort -- Find smallest item in the list and swap
		TC - Best - O(n^2), Worst - O(n^2) SC - O(1)
	
	Merge Sort -- use technique (Divide and conquer)
		TC - Best - O(n log N), Worst - O(n log N)  SC - O(n)
		
		
	Quick Sort -- use technique (Divide and conquer)
		TC - Best - O(n log N), Worst - O(n^2)  SC - O(log N)
